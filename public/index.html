							<p>I recently read this Wired article detailing some of the experiences of Tesla employees with Elon Musk as they struggled through their Tesla Model 3 production woes throughout 2017 and 2018. Several things stood out from this article (Musk’s firing rampages, the exodus of upper level management, etc.) but none more so than one inalienable fact: the drive with which the hardworking employees at Tesla are working to fulfill their mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. With this in mind, my passion for one of their flagship products, the Tesla Model S, was also reaffirmed. The model S is, to put it simply, a cool electric vehicle with incredible features that stands strong when compared to its alternatives and when assessing its faults. It’s a vehicle that takes my breath away. Continue reading to find out why!</p>
							<p>Disclaimer: While I do not yet own this product (being in college hasn’t quite yielded the opportunity to acquire the $60k+ I need to purchase it) I fell in love with this product the first time I saw it and all the time I've been inside of one.</p>

					<h3>What does the Model S achieve?</h3>

					<p>The goal of the Tesla Model S (and, in fact, all of Tesla’s vehicles) is, simply put, to make driving electric better and fun. This means minimizing the compromises a driver must make between a standard gas car and an electric car. Predecessors to Tesla’s electric vehicles made driving electric impractical and unspectacular due to range limits and lack of enhanced vehicular features. Unlike the model S, these predecessors did not run like sports cars or support nearly as many technological advancements. Tesla pushed the idea of what an electric vehicle in particular and a vehicle in general could be with its infotainment system, autopilot, and other such features.</p>

					<p>Moreover, rather prudently, along with producing an excellent electric vehicle, Tesla invested in supporting infrastructure like charging stations. For Drivers in the United States, Tesla in fact made it possible to drive around the United States, hopping from charging station to charging station, with the Model S, a feat previously unimaginable.</p>

					<h3> What’s so special about it?</h3>

					<p>While it would have been impressive enough to release an electric vehicle with the specs of the model S, this vehicle amazes me with its spectacular infotainment system, thoughtful interior design, and important company mission. </p>

					<p>When I first laid eyes upon the infotainment system I was blown away. Never before had I seen the central dashboard of a vehicle completely taken over by a tablet capable of controlling dozens of aspects of the vehicle. No buttons or knobs anywhere! It was even more impressive to learn that it is always connected to the internet, allowing live updates from the company that improve the functioning of the car. </p>

					<p>A well-known example of this update capability being put to use can be seen with the creep feature. This feature, toggled by a simple on/off switch on the infotainment system, allows the model S to creep forward. When the driver releases their foot form the brake (similar to an automatic transmission vehicle). The release of this feature was a direct result of customer feedback advocating for this occurrence. All it took was a simple update relayed by the infotainment system and users across the world could enable creep mode! When combined with autopilot, magic door handles, lane assist, and other such features, the Model S becomes a technological marvel on wheels and not just another vehicle.</p>

					<p>Certain, perhaps less significant, design decisions of the interior of the Tesla model S also impress me. For example, the model S, having no front engine, has unoccupied space towards the head of the vehicle. Instead of simply leaving a void in the vehicle that allowed nothing for it users, the model S features an aptly named frunk for storage. The frunk increases the already plentiful storage capabilities of the model S’ trunk which itself has a deep pocket that can be used for additional storage or seating. The additional affordances provided by these decisions allow an unparalleled storage flexibility within the vehicle.</p>

					<p>And now a short story:</p>

					<p>Many years ago, I took a trip to North Carolina with my family. Starting in Maryland, where I grew up, this was a five-hour drive. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem as I have a family of four and the car we used comfortably fit all of us. As we were loading into the vehicle, a family friend arrived at our home. Unbeknownst to me, she was to join us on our journey within our car. Me, being the youngest, was forced to take the middle seat. I cried. With the raised floor and narrower seat, I was largely uncomfortable throughout the entire trip.</p>

					<p>So, you can see, I am predisposed to having a deep appreciation for vehicle that make appropriate accommodations in the back seat. I want those that come after me to have a better life than I. The model S back seat area has a flat floor and bench seating, allowing three passengers to fit comfortably and without a worsened experience for the middle seat taker. Additionally, for users of this vehicle with families, the bench design allows for up to three car seats at once. These details are perhaps not the most impressive of the model S, but they nevertheless show the wide range of possibilities the Tesla affords, which is highly impressive to me.</p>

					<p>The mission that drives the people behind Tesla - to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy - is an important one. As a firm believer in global warming as a direct result of pollution caused by human activity, I try to do what I can to decrease my own carbon footprint. Purchasing a Tesla model 6 would, in my eyes, be a very direct step towards this guiding principle of mine. In other words, purchasing a Tesla not only fulfills my desire to own the product, but also helps me fulfill a responsibility I believe many of us, merely by being humans on this planet, have. Each step any of us takes toward reducing our carbon footprint ensures the health of our planet for future generations.</p>

					<h3> Alternatives </h3>

					<p>To understand why I have such a strong appreciation for this vehicle requires a brief survey of its competitors.</p>

					<p>Obviously, the vast majority of cars on the road are standard, gas consuming automatic vehicles, and these are indeed competitors to the Tesla model S. They are familiar, fast to refuel (5 – 10 minutes for full tank vs. 20 minutes to several hours), and far cheaper to buy.</p>

					<p>The introduction of model S, however, makes familiar seem stale, given the number of technological advancements. And while traditional vehicles undeniably have quicker refueling times, the technology is continuously improving and current owners often have long chucks within their days during which they can charge their vehicle at no inconvenience to them (i.e. at work, while they sleep, etc.)</p>

					<p>Additionally, Tesla is not the only company producing electric vehicles. Examples of startups in the space include Rivian, Faraday future, and Lucid air. Being start-ups, there is still so much uncertainty surrounding their products and the promises their making. Time will tell if they do indeed come to be close rivals with the model S. Even if they do, they will have to overcome Tesla’s ever-growing dominance, reputation, and strong brand. Moreover, these start-ups currently do not plan to allow their cars to be utilized by Tesla’s extensive charging infrastructure (which they have offered), presenting yet another barrier these startups will face.</p>

					<p>Well known auto manufacturers are also working on their own electric vehicles (i.e. Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc.). These companies all have decades of experience building vehicles with the capability to hire the various types of engineers they need to allow their vehicles to offer the same technological capabilities of the model S. It is not unreasonable, then, to expect that they should be able to produce electric vehicles that far outpace the Model S. Additionally, their size permits economies of scale, yielding the potential to offer a better price for a comparable model. Unfortunately, the vehicles produced thus far have not been up to par. These vehicles have often lacked an appealing design and/or do not have the same specs and range as the model S. I invite you to look through the following side by side view of various electric vehicle models and the model S. Looking at them side by side make the shortcomings of the alternatives even more apparent.</p> 

					<p>Prius and other hybrid vehicles have been around for years as well but for much of the same reasons above, to put it simply, these vehicles are just not as appealing as the Tesla model 6.</p>

					<Insert carousel comparator>

					<p>Even with all of these competitors, Tesla remains far ahead in its ability to make a compelling electric vehicle that people actually want to buy. Its charging infrastructure and its huge amount of autopilot data (1 Billion miles driven on autopilot!), among other aspects of the company, are strong pillars that support their dominance today and for at least the next several years.</p>

					<h3> No product is without sin </h3>

					<p>All products have faults. The model S is no exception. </p>

					<p>The model S can be cost prohibitive for the majority of would be users. The price ranges from $60K to $130k depending on the model and configuration of additional features you choose. There have also been complaints that, for passengers over 6 feet, sitting in the back can be somewhat uncomfortable due to the sloping ceiling of the vehicle. </p>

					<p>As mentioned before, charging is not as fast as refueling for a traditional vehicle. It takes anywhere form 20 minutes to several hours depending on the amount of charge sought and the charging device.</p>

					<p>Finally, there is in fact an indirect carbon footprint in areas whose electricity production depends heavily on carbon emitting techniques. Thus, the transition to this vehicle for environmentally conscious individuals such as myself does not necessary entail a complete reduction in said individuals vehicular carbon footprint.</p>

					<p>These faults are not without recourse, however. While the upfront cost is prohibitive, there are long term cost savings that can justify the expense. With the average American spending $2000 a year on gas, ownership of the model S would reduce this amount to 0. If this isn’t enough, we are lucky enough to have the currently model 3 available which is a cheaper, less impressive version of the model S, but still worth every penny.</p> 

					<p>Also, longer charging times may be spawning an entire new industry. Companies are starting to transform charging stations into lifestyle products. An excellent example of this is Nio house which offers a number of services within charging stations. In this way, charging one’s electric vehicle could become a convenient benefit for tesla owners.</p>

					<p>With regard to the indirect carbon footprint, while it is unfortunate reality we face today, there is some hope. Tesla offers clean energy infrastructure that an owner can install in their homes which can then be used to charge the vehicle. Despite this being beyond the scope of Tesla’s immediate goals, they are still impressively dedicated to their company mission!</p>

					<p>Put together, the Tesla model S is a technological platform on wheels. As icing on the cake, the vehicle is also the safest, coolest, fastest, best performing, and convenient electric vehicle on the market. I aim to own one within the next 5 years, salary permitting!</p>
