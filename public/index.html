					<p>I recently read <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-life-inside-gigafactory/" target="_blank">this</a> in depth Wired article that detailed some of the experiences of Tesla employees and Elon Musk as they struggled through their Tesla Model 3 production woes during the past few years. Several things stood out from this article for me (Musk’s firing rampages, the exodus of upper level management, etc.), but none more so than one inalienable fact: that Musk and his employees are driven to the extremes by thier devotion to Tesla's <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/mission-tesla" target="_blank">mission</a> to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. My admiration for the employees and thier leader thus grew along with my passion for one of their flagship products, the Tesla Model S. The model S is, to put it simply, an advanced electric vehicle with an incredible array of features that place it far ahead of its alternatives and make up for its faults. It’s truly a vehicle and product that takes my breath away. Continue reading to find out why!</p>
						
									

					<p>Disclaimer: While I do not yet own this product (being in college hasn’t quite yielded the opportunity to acquire the $70k+ I need to purchase it) I fell in love with this product the first time I saw it and have had this love reignited every time I've been inside of one read about recent updates with company or its products.</p>

					<h2>What does the Model S achieve?</h2>

					<p>The goal of the Tesla Model S (and, in fact, all of Tesla’s vehicles) is to make driving electric better and fun. This means minimizing the compromises a driver must make between a standard gas car and an electric car. Fully electric predecessors to the Model S were rendered less practical due to their range limitations. Additionally, aside from the energy source, driving these vehicles had minor differences from standard gas vehicles, provided little reason for users not solely driven by their environmental impact to want an electric vehicle. These predecessors did not run like sports cars or support nearly as many technological advancements as the Model S. In essence, Tesla successfully pushed the idea of what an electric vehicle in particular and a vehicle in general could be with its infotainment system, autopilot, and other such features.</p>

					<p>Moreover, rather prudently, along with producing an excellent electric vehicle, Tesla invested in supporting infrastructure like charging stations. For Drivers in the United States, Tesla in fact made it possible to drive around the United States, hopping from charging station to charging station, with the Model S, a feat previously unimaginable.</p>

					<h2> What’s so special about it?</h2>

					<p>While it would have been impressive enough to release an electric vehicle with the specs of the model S, this vehicle amazes me with its spectacular infotainment system, thoughtful interior design, and the important company mission that drives the entirety of their work, as mentioned before. </p>

					<p>When I first laid eyes upon the tablet infotainment system my understanding of the current year became distorted. Surely such a vehicle was just a concept car that we would see many years from now. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that wasn't the case. Never before had I seen the central dashboard of a vehicle completely taken over by a tablet capable of controlling dozens of aspects of the vehicle. No buttons or knobs anywhere! Being a long time user of iphones and ipads, the 17 inch tablet is also highly intuitive and familiar for me and other millenials like me. It was even more impressive to learn that it is always connected to the internet, allowing live updates from the company that improve the functioning of the car. This feature truly made the car feel cutting edge and futuristic.</p>

					<p>A <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079071_official-2012-tesla-model-s-to-be-given-creep-option" target="_blank">well-known example of this update capability</a> being put to use can be seen with the creep feature. This feature, toggled by a simple on/off switch on the infotainment system, allows the model S to creep forward. When the driver releases their foot form the brake (similar to an automatic transmission vehicle). The release of this feature was a direct result of customer feedback advocating for this occurrence. All it took was a simple update relayed by the infotainment system and users across the world could enable creep mode! Such a feature allows the Model S to, on top of everything else, be a highly user oriented platform. When combined with autopilot, electric door handles, lane assist, and other such features, the Model S becomes a technological marvel on wheels.</p>

					<p>Certain, perhaps less significant, design decisions of the Tesla Model S interior are just as impressive to me for their thoughtfulness. For example, the model S, having no front engine, has unoccupied space towards the head of the vehicle. Instead of simply leaving a void in the vehicle that afforded nothing to its users, the model S features an aptly named frunk (front trunk) for storage. The frunk increases the already plentiful storage capabilities of the model S’ trunk which itself has a deep pocket that can be used for additional storage or seating. The additional affordances provided by these decisions allow an unparalleled storage flexibility within the vehicle.</p>

					<p>And now a short story:</p>

					<p>Many years ago, I want on a trip to North Carolina with my family to attend a mairrage between my cousin and his beloved. Because we were driving and starting in Maryland, where I grew up, this would be a five-hour drive. Normally such a drive would not be a problem, as I have a family of four and the car we used for trips like these comfortably fit all of us. As we were loading into the vehicle, a family friend arrived at our home. Perhaps she needed to drop something off before we left? I felt I had nothing to worry about. Then I saw her suitcase and although I denied the relatty I was to face, the increase in my anxiety was undeniable. Upon questinoing my parents, it was announced to me that she was to join us on our journey within our car. I knew immediately that me, being the youngest, would be forced to take the middle seat. I cried. With the raised floor and narrower seat, I was largely uncomfortable throughout the entire trip. Fin.</p>

					<p>You can see now why I might be predisposed to having a deep appreciation for a vehicle that makes appropriate accommodations for passengers in the back seat; No one should go through what I had to endure years go. The model S rear seat area has a flat floor with bench seating, allowing three passengers to fit comfortably and without a worsened experience for the middle seat taker. Additionally, for users of this vehicle with families, the bench design allows for up to three car seats at once. These details are perhaps not the most impressive of the model S, but they nevertheless show the wide range of possibilities the Tesla affords, which is highly impressive to me.</p>

					<p>Finally, the mission that drives the people behind Tesla - to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy - is an important one. As a firm believer in global warming as a direct result of pollution caused by human activity, I try to do what I can to decrease my own carbon footprint. Purchasing a Tesla Model S would, in my eyes, be a very direct step towards this guiding principle of mine. In other words, purchasing a Tesla not only fulfills my desire to own the product, but also helps me fulfill a responsibility I along with many of us, merely by being humans on this planet, have to the planet. The Model S gives you the best of both worlds</p>

					<h2> Alternatives </h2>

					<p>Understaning my strong appreciation for this vehicle requires a brief survey of its competitors.</p>

					<p>Obviously, the vast majority of cars on the road are standard, gas consuming automatic vehicles, and these are indeed competitors to the Tesla model S. They are familiar, fast to refuel (5 – 10 minutes for full tank vs. 20 minutes to several hours), and far cheaper to buy.</p>

					<p>The introduction of model S, however, makes familiar seem stale, given the number of technological advancements the vehicle brings to the table. And while traditional vehicles undeniably have quicker refueling times, the technology is <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/05/21/tesla-supercharger-v3-quicker-charging-summer/" target="_blank">continuously improving</a> and current owners often have long chucks within their days during which they can charge their vehicle at no inconvenience to them (i.e. at work, while they sleep, etc.). I would likely charge my vehicle while at work or at the gym.</p>

					<p>Additionally, Tesla is not the only company producing advanced electric vehicles. There are startups in the space like <a href="https://products.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a>, <a href="https://www.ff.com/" target="_blank">Faraday future</a>, and <a href="https://lucidmotors.com/" target="_blank">Lucid air</a>. Being start-ups, there is an abundance of uncertainty surrounding their products and the promises these companies are making. Time will tell if they do indeed come to be close rivals with the model S and other Tesla vehicles. Even if they do, they will have to overcome Tesla’s ever-growing dominance, reputation, and brand. Moreover, these start-ups currently do not plan to allow their cars to be utilized by Tesla’s extensive charging infrastructure (which Tesla has offered to them), presenting yet another barrier these startups will face.</p>

					<p>Well known auto manufacturers are also working on their own electric vehicles (i.e. Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc.). These companies all have decades of experience building vehicles with the capability to hire the various types of engineers they need to allow their vehicles to offer the same technological capabilities as the model S. It is not unreasonable, then, to expect that they should be able to produce electric vehicles that far outpace the Model S. Additionally, their size permits economies of scale, yielding the potential to offer a better price for a comparable model. Unfortunately, the vehicles produced thus far have not been up to par. These vehicles have often lacked an appealing design and/or high quality specs like the model S. I invite you to look through the following side by side view of various electric vehicle models and the model S. This view makes the shortcomings of the alternatives even more apparent. Moreover, look at the shapes of the various vehicles you see.</p>

				    <p>Did you see that? The way in which all of the Tesla alternatives - excluding the future offerings of Rivian and Lucid Air - have a bubble like shape? This design <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/97760520/car-question-19-why-do-electric-vehicles-have-to-look-so-silly" target="_blank">(known as the Kamm tail)</a> helps improve aerodynamic efficiency. Interestlingy enough, however, the Tesla Model S beats a majority of these vehicles in aerodynamic efficiency, as measured by its drag coefficient without utilizing many of the aspects of this somewhat silly shape.</p>

				    <p>Prius and other hybrid vehicles have been around for years as well but for much of the same reasons above, these vehicles are just not as appealing as the Tesla Model S.</p>

					<p>With all of these competitors, Tesla remains far ahead in its ability to make a compelling electric vehicle that people actually want to buy. Its charging infrastructure and its <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/07/17/tesla-autopilot-miles-shadow-mode-report/" target="_blank">considerable autopilot</a> data (1 Billion miles driven on autopilot!), among other aspects of the company, are strong pillars that support their dominance today, and for at least the next several years.</p>

					<h2> No product is perfect </h2>

					<p>All products have faults. The Model S is no exception and has room for improvemement.</p>

					<p>The infotainment system has its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15827652/2016-tesla-model-s-17-inch-tablet-electric-vehicle-screendrive-review" target="_blank">limitations</a>. Without internet connectivty, some of its features become unavailable. Additionally, it present a large potential distratction that could dangerous for many on the road. It is also outfitted with voice commands that are not nearly as advanced as those offered by Apple or Google. </p>
					<p>The model S can be cost prohibitive for the majority of would be users. The price ranges from $60K to $130k depending on the model and configuration of additional features you choose. The list side-by-side view above clearly shows that many of the alternatives have significantly lower prices. 

					<p>There have also been complaints that, for passengers over 6 feet, sitting in the back can be somewhat uncomfortable due to the sloping ceiling of the vehicle. </p>

					<p>As mentioned before, charging is not as fast as refueling for a traditional vehicle. It takes anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours depending on the amount of charge sought and the charging device.</p>

					<p>Finally, there is in fact an <a href="ttps://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/101642/us-report-finds-tesla-model-s-can-emit-more-lifetime-co2-than-a-petrol-supermini" target="_blank">indirect carbon footprint</a> in areas whose electricity production depends heavily on carbon emitting techniques. Thus, the transition to this vehicle for environmentally conscious individuals such as myself does not necessary entail a complete reduction in said individuals vehicular carbon footprint.</p>

					<p>These faults, while highlighting ways the Model S could be improve, are not without recourse. 
					The infotainment system keeps track of certain stateful data items that allow a majority of its most valuable features to be available without internt connectivity and the size of the screen allow the most important information, like navigation, to be displayed clearly and prominently. </p>

					<p>While the upfront cost is prohibitive, there are long term cost savings that can justify the expense. With the average American spending <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/14/heres-how-much-gasoline-the-average-american-consu.aspx" target="_blank">$1,400 a year on gas</a>, ownership of the model S would reduce this amount to 0. If this isn’t enough, we are lucky enough to have the model 3 currently available which is a cheaper, less impressive version of the model S, but still worth every penny.</p> 

					<p>Moreover, longer charging times may be spawning an entire new industry. Companies are starting to transform charging stations into lifestyle products. An excellent example of this is <a href="https://www.nio.io/nio-house" target="_blank">Nio house</a> which offers a number of services within charging stations. Imagine parking your car at a Nio house station to charge for 30 minutes and spending the time in a clean space offering child care rooms, kitchen, and workspaces for anyone. If that's not enough, there are already quick charge stations in convenient parking lots, although not quite as wide spread in certain areas. Even as Tesla and continues to improve its charging times, It makes charging less and less of a pain.</p>

					<p>With regard to the indirect carbon footprint, while it is unfortunate reality we face today, there is some hope. Tesla offers clean energy infrastructure that an owner can install in their homes which can then be used to charge the vehicle. Despite this being beyond the scope of Tesla’s immediate goals, they are still impressively dedicated to their company mission!</p>

					<p>Put together, the Tesla model S is a technological platform on wheels. As icing on the cake, the vehicle is also the safest, coolest, fastest, best performing, and convenient electric vehicle on the market. With all this, no matter how hard I try, I can only come to one conclusion: the Tesla model S is the best electric car avaialable today and is truly my favorite product as a result.</p>
